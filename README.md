=====================
link state ==> up/down
Layer 2 and layer 3 addresses
bandwith rate,reliability,Tx and Rx loads
speed and duplex(please check thaat the duplex is matched on both ends of the cable)
encapsulation type
1. look for up up in the first line so that it's working up to the second layer,
if there is an issue in layer 1/2 there will be up down, but if the line is shut down then it will be down down.
Causes tht cause the line to be down down
Administrative shutdown
 Cable disconnection or failure
 Poor line/signal quality
 Speed or Duplex mismatch
 EtherChannel negotiation failure
 Encapsulation (Layer 2 protocol) mismatch
 VLAN mismatch
 STP port blocking
 PoE overload 
â—¦ End device pulls more power than switchport can delive
It could be that tne port is not pluged or in use.
